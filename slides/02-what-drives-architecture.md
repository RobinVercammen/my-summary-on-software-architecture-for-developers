## What drives architecture


## Functional
*Requirements*


## Quality (1)
*Applicable on functional*
* How fast (performance)
* Scalable
* Available
* Security
* Disaster recovery
* Monitoring / proactivity
* i18n / l10n
* flexible


## Quality (2)
* Shared vision
* Technical leadership
* Consistent code quality
* Consistent way to build features
* Structure
* Learning (PR's)


## Constraints (1)
* $$$
* Technology
* People


## Constraints (2)
Technology
* past failures
* interopability
* Similar to current landscape
* licensing


## Principles
Development, Architecture


## Principles (1)
Development
* Coding standard
* Unit tests
* Static analyses


## Principles (2)
Architecture
* Layers (no dal logic in domain)
* Business layer 
* Cohesion > Coupling
* Rich vs Anemic domain model: consistency
* Eventual consistent or not?
